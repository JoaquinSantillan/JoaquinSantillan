### console.log(Hello World 👋🌎)

I am Joaquin Santillan, a 🚀 Full Stack programmer from 🇦🇷 Argentina with a passion for technology and constant learning. I love combining my programming knowledge with some of my favorite hobbies such as 🌌 astrophysics, 💪 gym, 🎮 video games, and 🍳 cooking. I also enjoy sharing my knowledge with others and giving talks about technology.

In my free time, I like to experiment with new technologies and programming tools and share my projects through my TikTok channel. On this channel, I teach how to create programming projects and discuss relevant topics about technology and programming.
